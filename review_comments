1. Passing scope as parameter is a very Bad practice. Never pass on scopes to controllers/services or any called function outside the scope. Inn the submitData() api of managerService, scope of controller is passed. Instead pass data which is needed for updation.

2. Show success as well as error messages. 

3. There should always be a user re-confirmation before removing/deleting data.

4. Show help on hovering action icons like View/Edit/Delete

5. Show proper messages for validations. for eg. below  messages should contain field name "Name" in place of "Message"
			Message must be over 3 characters
			Message must not exceed 30 characters
